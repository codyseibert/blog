Hey everyone! I'm Cody Seibert.

For anyone unaware, I'm growing a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/codyseibert) where I post a lot of videos related to coding tutorials, talks about software, and mini projects. The main focus of the channel is web development, but I also play around with artificial intelligence, such as in this [video where I build an AI to jump over blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh8smVUwrns&t=5s), and computer vision, such as in [this video where I teach about template matching](), and sometimes game programming like [this time lapse video of me building PONG using Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tbepogkt3c). The plan for this blog is to help me get organized and collect my thoughts of these various tutorials and put them in writing so that a larger audience can still learn about the topics I speak about without having to invest time in watching a full video.

So who am I and why do I think I'm qualified to post videos about software? I'm a full stack engineer who has been working in the industry going on 5 years now. Back in 2013 I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor's degree of Computer Science. At college, I was part of the programming team for a year where we were taught how to solve complex program problems working as a team of 3 students. Prior to college, I took a couple of programming classes in high school.

I still have a ton to learn about software engineering, but I'd like to start sharing the things I have learned over the years with the community of programmers. My goals for this blog is to at least post 1 blog post a day, and I think I can achieve it if I put my mind to it. Writing isn't my strongest skill, so I think a post a day will help my abilities.

Stay tuned!
